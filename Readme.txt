This program determines the alphabetical rank of a word based upon all combinations of letters making up the word.
If running in Eclipse, be sure to add a word as an argument by selecting Run > Run Configurations > Arguments.
If the argument includes numeric values or symbols, the program will order them based on their Ascii values.
